# SIGNAL WARFARE: Tactical Electromagnetic Combat

## VISION DOCUMENT v1.0

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

*Signal Warfare* is a fast-paced, realistic electronic warfare simulation that places players in command of advanced RF systems, drones, and jammers. The game combines military strategy with authentic electromagnetic physics, creating both an engaging tactical experience and an educational platform for understanding real-world RF concepts.

The core gameplay revolves around deploying surveillance assets, strategically placing jammers, and launching attack drones while countering enemy electronic warfare measures. Players interact through an advanced AI assistant (RAVEN) that both simplifies complex actions and teaches RF warfare principles through natural language commands.

## 1. CORE GAME MECHANICS

### 1.1 ELECTRONIC WARFARE SYSTEMS

**Jammers:**
- Configurable frequency selection (433MHz, 915MHz, 1.5GHz, 2.4GHz, 5.8GHz)
- Power levels measured in realistic dBm and EIRP values
- Dynamic power management (higher power = better range but easier detection)
- Heat management and cooldown periods for high-power operation

**Antennas:**
- **Omnidirectional:** 360° coverage with 2-3 dBi gain
- **Helicone:** Compact directional with 8-12 dBi gain, circular polarization
- **Helix:** Higher gain (12-15 dBi) with excellent axial ratio
- **Horn:** Extreme directionality (15-20 dBi) for precision jamming

**Drones:**
- **Attack Drones:** Payload delivery to target objectives
- **Surveillance Drones:** Reconnaissance and signal intelligence
- **Electronic Warfare Drones:** Mobile jamming platforms

**Navigation Systems:**
- GPS (1575.42MHz) - US system
- GLONASS (1602MHz) - Russian system
- Galileo (1575.42MHz) - European system
- BeiDou (1561.098MHz) - Chinese system
- Spoofing and jamming capabilities for each

### 1.2 RF PROPAGATION PHYSICS

The game implements realistic RF propagation models:

- **Free Space Path Loss:** FSPL(dB) = 20log₁₀(d) + 20log₁₀(f) + 32.45
- **Multipathing Effects:** Signal reflection from terrain and structures
- **Diffraction:** RF shadows behind hills and buildings
- **Atmospheric Attenuation:** Weather affecting signal propagation
- **Doppler Effects:** Frequency shifts from moving objects

Signal strength is visualized through color-coded cones emanating from transmitters:
- Red: Strongest signal (-30dBm to -50dBm)
- Yellow: Moderate signal (-50dBm to -70dBm)
- Green: Weak signal (-70dBm to -85dBm)
- Blue: Threshold signal (-85dBm to -95dBm)

### 1.3 TACTICAL ADVANTAGE INDICATOR

A clear, central UI element shows mission progress:
- Horizontal bar showing balance of electronic dominance
- Shifts based on jamming effectiveness, asset status, and objective control
- Color gradient reinforces status (red = enemy advantage, blue = player advantage)

Supporting metrics displayed minimally:
- Signal Dominance percentage
- Asset Status fraction
- Target Lock progress
