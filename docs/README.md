# ECHO ZERO Documentation

This folder contains all documentation and technical context for the ECHO ZERO project.

## Core Documentation

- [**ECHO_ZERO_VISION.md**](./SIGNAL_WARFARE_VISION.md) - The master vision document describing the game concept, mechanics, and design principles.
- [**ROADMAP.md**](./ROADMAP.md) - Development roadmap with phased implementation plans and priorities.

## Technical Components

- [**CLAUDE_INTEGRATION.md**](./CLAUDE_INTEGRATION.md) - Details the integration with Anthropic's Claude AI through proxy architecture.
- [**RAVEN_AI_ASSISTANT.md**](./RAVEN_AI_ASSISTANT.md) - Documents the RAVEN AI assistant implementation and command processing.
- [**RF_PROPAGATION.md**](./RF_PROPAGATION.md) - Explains the RF propagation physics models and signal visualization.
- [**INTERFACE_COMPONENTS.md**](./INTERFACE_COMPONENTS.md) - Describes the UI components and their implementation.
- [**AI_AGENT_INTEGRATION.md**](./AI_AGENT_INTEGRATION.md) - Outlines how to make the game fully playable by AI agents.
- [**CLAUDE.md**](./CLAUDE.md) - Instructions for Claude and other AI assistants working on this project.

## Using This Documentation

These documents are designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of both the vision for ECHO ZERO and its technical implementation. They serve multiple purposes:

1. **Project Reference** - Complete description of how components work and interact
2. **Development Guide** - Technical details for building or rebuilding components
3. **Educational Resource** - Explanations of concepts like RF propagation and AI integration
4. **Vision Alignment** - Ensuring all development stays true to the core concept

When implementing or modifying any aspect of ECHO ZERO, start by reviewing the relevant documentation to understand both the technical details and how they fit into the broader vision.

## Update Practices

When making significant changes to the application:

1. Update the relevant documentation to reflect the changes
2. Ensure changes align with the vision document
3. Keep code examples in documentation synchronized with actual implementation
4. Add new documentation files for major new features
